Esp32 C6 on-board RGB LED example in Arduino and PlatformIO


I needed a barebone PlatformIO Hello Wrld program for the ESP C6 in Arduino. When setting up a new environment sometimes you just need a simple setup that requires no outside hardware to be run so you can test everything before you start developing. 

Since I couldn't find anything I decided to create one for myself. I thought it would be obvious to use the on-board RGB LED since it's already there.

So here is it. The program changes blinks the color of the built in LED and changes it between red, green, and blue.
