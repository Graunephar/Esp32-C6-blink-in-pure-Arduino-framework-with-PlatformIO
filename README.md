Esp32 C6 on-board RGB LED example in Arduino and PlatformIO

Thsi program is a basic example of how to use the on-board LED in Arduino. If you would rather have an example in ESP-IDF you can find it in (this repo)[https://github.com/Graunephar/ESP32-C6-on-board-LED-blink-example-in-ESP-IDF-with-PlatformIO]

I needed a barebone PlatformIO Hello Wold program for the ESP C6 in Arduino. When setting up a new environment sometimes you just need a simple setup that requires no outside hardware to be run so you can test everything before you start developing. 

Since I couldn't find anything I decided to create one for myself. I thought it would be obvious to use the on-board RGB LED since it's already there.

So here is it. The program changes blinks the color of the built in LED and changes it between red, green, and blue.
